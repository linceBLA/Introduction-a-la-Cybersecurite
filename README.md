# Introduction-a-la-Cybersecurite

## Audience
I had the opportunity to present an introduction to cybersecurity to the French expat community in the UAE. This group, which frequently travels and relies heavily on digital communication, often lacks awareness about cybersecurity, especially among those not working for large companies with comprehensive training programs. My presentation aimed to address this gap and provide essential knowledge to help them navigate the digital world more securely.


## Purpose

In my presentation I provided an overview of cybersecurity, focusing on its growing importance and the various threats individuals and organizations face. Given their frequent travel and extensive use of digital communication, it was crucial to address these issues and enhance their awareness.

***What is Cybersecurity?***

I started by defining cybersecurity and explaining its significance. Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, which have been increasing at an alarming rate. The statistics and growing number of cyber incidents underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to safeguard against these evolving threats.

***Types of Cyberattacks***

I outlined the various types of cyberattacks, including cybercriminality, ransomware, phishing, DDoS attacks, defacement, and spying (e.g., Trojan horses). Additionally, I discussed terrorist attacks, such as sabotage, which illustrate the severe consequences of cybersecurity breaches.

***Examples and Impact of Cyberattacks***

I presented notable examples like the Darkside group’s attack on Colonial Pipeline, the SolarWinds breach, and the WannaCry ransomware incident. I also explained how cyberattacks played a role in the start of the Ukraine conflict, highlighting the growing significance of cyberwarfare in today’s global landscape.

***Tips for Cybersecurity***

To help the audience protect themselves, I shared practical tips, including using strong passwords, employing password managers, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), managing the risk of Free-WIFI, keeping software updated, using antivirus protection, and regularly backing up data. I also recommended checking with tools like “Have I Been Pwned” and “VirusTotal” to monitor and protect their online presence.

I was pleased to see that the audience gained valuable insights from the presentation and now recognizes the importance of cybersecurity. Their awareness of the issue had significantly grown, and they left with a better understanding of how crucial it is to protect not only themselves but also broader systems from cyber threats.
